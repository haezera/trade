## _about_
pytrading began as a learning experience into the quantitative and algorithmic trading game. From a young age, i was interested into investments and trading as my father had always invested whatever savings he had into stocks. 
From this upbringing, a decent, pop knowledge of finance and quantiative finance was gained; but I wanted to understand the mathematical foundations.

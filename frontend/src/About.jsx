          This web app was created by me, Haeohreum. From a young age, I was
          taught about the value of investing. This app is a manifestation of
          that education.

          This web app will probably never be finished, as it was intended to be
          more of an educational opportunity more than a genuine start-to-finish
          project. But I'm ensuring some semblance of usability in the stock
          lookup.
